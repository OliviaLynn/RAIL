# RAIL: Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers

RAIL is a flexible software library providing tools to produce at-scale photometric redshift data products, including uncertainties and summary statistics, and stress-test them under realistically complex systematics.
A detailed description of RAIL's modular structure is available in the [Overview Section](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/overview.html) on ReadTheDocs.

RAIL serves as the infrastructure supporting many extragalactic applications of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, including Rubin-wide commissioning activities. 
RAIL was initiated by the Photometric Redshifts (PZ) Working Group (WG) of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) as a result of the lessons learned from the [Data Challenge 1 (DC1) experiment](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/499/2/1587/5905416) to enable the PZ WG Deliverables in [the LSST-DESC Science Roadmap (see Sec. 5.18)](https://lsstdesc.org/assets/pdf/docs/DESC_SRM_latest.pdf), aiming to guide the selection and implementation of redshift estimators in DESC analysis pipelines.
RAIL is developed and maintained by a diverse team comprising of DESC Pipeline Scientists (PSs), international in-kind contributors, LSST Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Computing (LINCC) Frameworks software engineers, and other volunteers, but all are welcome to join the team regardless of LSST data rights. 

## Installation

Installation instructions are available in the [Installation section](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/installation.html) on ReadTheDocs.

## Contributing

The greatest strength of RAIL is its extensibility; those interested in contributing to RAIL should start by consulting the [Contributing section](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/contributing.html) on ReadTheDocs.

## Citing RAIL

RAIL is open source and may be used according to the terms of its [LICENSE](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/blob/main/LICENSE) [(BSD 3-Clause)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
If you make use of the ideas or software here in any publication, you must cite this repository <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL> as "LSST-DESC PZ WG (in prep)" with the [Zenodo DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7017551).
Please consider also inviting the developers as co-authors on publications resulting from your use of RAIL by [making an issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RAIL/issues/new/choose).
Additionally, several of the codes accessible through the RAIL ecosystem must be cited if used in a publication.
A convenient list of what to cite may be found in the [Citing RAIL](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/citing.html) section on ReadTheDocs.

## Future Plans

Potential extensions of the RAIL package are summarized in the [Future Plans section](https://lsstdescrail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/futureplans.html) on ReadTheDocs.
